# Self Types for Dependently Typed Lambda Encodings

## `AllTm` vs `PiTm` types

The `AllTm` type corresponds to infered term polymorphism. The `PiTm` type
corresponds to explicit term polymorphism (from `AbsTm` term)

I don't need both since I require explicit term and type polymorphism
everywhere.
